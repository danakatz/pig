#### What is Pig?

Pig is a game you play against the computer. The first player to get to 100 points wins.

On your turn, roll the dice as many times as you like by clicking the **Roll** button. Any roll that's 
not a 1 will be added to your running total for that turn; if you roll a 1, however, your turn ends and 
you lose all points from that turn. 

When you're satisfied with the number of points you've accumulated, click the **Hold** button to add that turn's 
score to your grand total. Now it's the computer's turn to roll. Continue taking turns until one player wins.
