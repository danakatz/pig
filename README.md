#### What is Pig?

Pig is a game you play against the computer. The first player to get to 100 points wins.

On your turn, click the **Roll** button to roll the dice as many time as you like. Any roll 
that's not a 1 will be added to your running total for that turn. When you've accumulated enough points,
click the **Hold** button to add that turn's score to the grand total. 

Remember : if you roll a 1 at any time, you lose all points from that turn and the computer gets to roll.
